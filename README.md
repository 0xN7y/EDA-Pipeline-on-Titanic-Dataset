This Repo is for assignment submition on Feature Importance,  Multicollinearity, Data Distributions &amp; Visualization for United Nation Development Program(UNDP) FTL Program


Q1: Feature Importance & Multicollinearity

Using the cleaned data under df, you are expected to:

    Implement a feature importance method different from the ones already experimented with in this case.
    Check for multicollinearity and covariance in the dataset.

Q2 2: Data Distributions & Visualization

    Work with at least five different types of data distributions.
    Visualize them using synthetic data.
